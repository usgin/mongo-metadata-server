In preparing these projections, MAG is required to follow standards established by ADOA. Subregional projections are used by MAG as input into the MAG transportation models to predict automobile traffic and as input into the MAG air quality models to predict emissions and concentrations. The projections are used by local governments to evaluate infrastructure improvements, for gauging regional development and land use plans, to prepare general plans.
